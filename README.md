## Description

According to the WHO, over 250 million people around the world suffer from moderate to severe vision loss, 81% of whom are above the age of 50. Many face significant challenges in daily life. Some of the leading solutions for a variety of vision impairments are extremely expensive headsets that essentially provide a zoomed-in view of the world.

Bright is a seed to make faces familiar again and everyday challenges manageable.

Bright runs as an app on Microsoft HoloLens and allows users to zoom in to a customizable level, hear written text (e.g. books, newspapers, documents, TV) as spoken speech, recognize other people nearby (giving names for stored people, and age/gender/emotion estimates for others), and contact others in the case of an emergency.

We built our solution in Unity, implementing various services from Microsoftâ€™s Azure Cognitive Services and Twilio for phone calls.
